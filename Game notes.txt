Ball bounces around on screen and goal is to get the ball into a certain
area to win the level, then the game progresses to the next level.
Levels are puzzles, get successively more complicated.

User controls ball by imparting horizontal force when the ball is on
a surface.

Player can get the ball to move vertically through the use of bumpers,
catapults, elevators, etc.

Levels could include gates, one way gates, buttons that unlock/change
the level. Accelerator and decelerator zones.

Bounce charactersistics can change from wall to wall. Changes in gravity
from level to level. 

Pinball looking ball, theme changes artistically from level to level
